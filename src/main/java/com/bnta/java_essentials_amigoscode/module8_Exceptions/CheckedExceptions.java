// There are two different types of exceptions:
// - Checked exceptions
// - Unchecked exceptions

// The difference between these...
// Checked exceptions are exceptions that need to be handled at compile time, which means that if a method is throwing a checked exception, we should handle that exception using the try catch block or using the throws keyword - otherwise, we will get a compilation error
// Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile time - this means that if the program is throwing an unchecked exception, and even if we don't handle that exception, we won't get a compilation error

//package com.bnta.java_essentials_amigoscode.module8_Exceptions;
//
//public class CheckedExceptions {
//
//    public static void main(String[] args) {
//
//    }
//
//}
